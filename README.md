# OSE C++ Library

This repository is a mirror of the OSE C++ Libraries, originally developed by an organization known at the time as the Austrailian Overseas Telecommunications Centre (OTC). [Graham Dumpleton](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton) is credited as a primary contributor.

I was nearly unable to find a download source for this library as of November 2023 when I stumbled upon an [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/tucows_8532_OSE) entry containing this version of the code. So I figured I would upload it to GitHub for posterity. The source as I received it was versioned as 8.0b4 (see PACKAGE file).

Credit on the archive.org upload is given to Tucows, Inc for "graciously \[donating] a copy of this software to the Internet Archive...for long term preservation and access."
