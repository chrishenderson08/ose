This directory is intended to be a demonstration of how an application
written using the messaging framework implemented by the OSE C++ class
libraries and Python wrappers can be integrated into Apache using the
"mod_python" framework. The "mod_python" package can be obtained from:

  http://www.modpython.org

The actual rendering of HTML pages is facilitated through a third party
package called "HTMLTemplate". The "HTMLTemplate" package can be obtained
from:

  http://freespace.virgin.net/hamish.sanderson/htmltemplate.html

The ".htaccess" was originally setup for use with "mod_python" version 2.X.
If using a later version, you may need to modify the SetHandler directive
to be consistent with changes made in later versions. It is recommended that
that Indexes and MultiViews be disabled.

NOTE: If you aren't interested in the "netsvc" package as a whole, you
can make a copy of the Apache mod_python handler and module cache contained
within the "netsvc" module and use it separately under the terms of the BSD
style license described in the "setup.py" file in the root source directory.

To do this, first replace the file called "_mputils/apache.py" with a copy
of the file "../../netsvc/apache/__init__.py". Next edit the copy and
replace the import line "from netsvc import cache" with "import cache"
instead. Finally, replace the file called "_mputils/cache.py" with a copy
of "../../netsvc/cache/__init__.py".
