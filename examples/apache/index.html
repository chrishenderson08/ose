<h1>Apache Integration</h1>

<p>
This directory is a demonstration of how an application written using the
messaging framework implemented by the OSE C++ class libraries and Python
wrappers can be integrated into Apache using
<a href="http://www.modpython.org">mod_python</a>.

</p>

<h2>The mod_python Handler</h2>

<p>
Apache integration is achieved using mod_python. This is an Apache module
that embeds the Python interpreter within the Apache server. With
mod_python it is possible to intercept specific HTTP requests and have your
own Python code executed in order to generate the desired result. In
practice one can define Python code to be executed for any of the different
processing phases for a request as implemented by Apache. In this example
only the content handler is being implemented in Python.

</p>
<p>
The actual Python code implementing the content handler is defined in the
"netsvc.apache" module. The content handler is designed so as to be executed
when any request which falls under this root directory is received.

</p>
<p>
Although all requests under this root directory are passed through the
content handler, only requests of interest are processed by it.
Specifically, only requests for files where an associated Python code
file is identified to be run in association with that request are actually
processed by the content handler. All other requests are passed back to
Apache to be handled.

</p>
<p>
What this means is that you can still have a mixture of file types in a
directory. For example, plain text or HTML files, image files as well as
any files which have Python code associated with them. Except for the
case where special Python code needs to be executed, the full speed of
Apache is used in returning the content of the file. Because any Python
code present relates to the implementation of the service being provided,
all requests to get the actual Python code files will however by default
be blocked.

</p>

<h2>Page Templating System</h2>

<p>
There are many different page templating systems available for building
web sites. In this example, the rendering of HTML pages is facilitated
through a third party package called
<a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hamish.sanderson/htmltemplate.html">
HTMLTemplate</a>. You should however be able to use any HTML page template
system designed for use with mod_python.

</p>
<p>
Unlike the majority of page templating systems, when using the HTMLTemplate
system there is a clean separation between the HTML markup and the Python
code used in producing it. That is, there is no Python code embedded within
the HTML markup, nor is the HTML markup embedded within the body of the
Python code.

</p>
<p>
The design of the "netsvc.apache" content handler and the provision of
a caching mechanism around HTMLTemplate encourages this separation even
further. This is done by making it easier to structure files such that the
HTML markup and Python code are actually in distinct files. That the Python
code is associated with a specific HTML file is generally denoted by giving
the file containing the Python code the same basename as the HTML file, but
with a ".py" extension instead of ".html" attached. For example, if the
HTML file is called "example.html", the Python code file associated with it
would be called "example.py".

</p>
<p>
Separating the Python code from the HTML markup has the advantage that
professional web page design software can be used to generate the HTML
files. The separate Python code can then be created as required by
the code developer. All the web page designer needs to do is include
the appropriate node designations in the HTML markup that the code will
reference.

</p>

<h2>Further Documentation</h2>

<p>
For now, this overview document isn't going to go any further into
describing how the system all hangs together. In time, everything will
be properly explained in the documentation for the Python wrappers
supplied with OSE. As such, the samples contained here and described
below will have to suffice as examples of what can be achieved.

</p>

<h2>Basic mod_python Test</h2>

<p>
The basic mod_python test as described in the mod_python documentation
is accessed as "<a href="mptest.html">mptest.html</a>". This illustrates
the first difference when using the "netsvc.apache" module.
Specifically, that although the Python code file is called 
"<a href="source/mptest.py">mptest.py</a>", you access the generated page
as "mptest.html".

</p>
<p>
Further, normally when using mod_python and the PythonHandler directive in
the ".htaccess" file is set to be a module such as "mptest", any access to
a file in that directory where the extension is ".py" would be processed
through the "mptest.py" file. This is not the case here and when using
the "netsvc.apache" module there can in fact be multiple content handlers
present within the same directory, the output of which is accessed under
unique URLs. Thus, the "netsvc.apache" module is not a content handler at
all, but merely works out which actual content handler to execute based on
what is requested.

</p>

<h2>Generating HTML Pages</h2>

<p>
A mod_python content handler can within itself explicitly generate any
HTML content. This can be a labourious task and so use of a page templating
system is often preferred. For this example, the HTMLTemplate module is
being used to assist in this process. The first illustration of this is
the "<a href="details.html">details.html</a>" page.

</p>
<p>
When you follow this link, reload the page a few times and you will see the
data contained within change upon each request. The information you see
presented on the page helps to illustrate a number of important concepts
related to the HTML page templating system, as well as the basic operation
of the "netsvc.apache" module.

</p>
<p>
The most obvious is the separation between the HTML markup and the Python
code which is executed to fill out the content within the page. The HTML
markup is stored in the file "<a href="source/details.html">details.html</a>"
and the Python code is stored in the file "<a href="source/details.py">
details.py</a>".

</p>
<p>
Examining the Python code one can see how the corresponding file containing
the HTML markup is loaded in as a template object, the data filled in and
the rendered result returned to the requesting client. The loading of the
file is mediated through a template cache so as to avoid reloading of a
page when it hasn't been changed.

</p>
<p>
This function of the cache can be illustrated if you were to touch the
"details.html" file such that its modification time is updated. On the
next attempt to access the page via the web server, you should see the
"page-hits" counter drop back to zero for that page. This demonstrates
that the content of the HTML file was reloaded.

</p>
<p>
As well as automatically reloading the HTML file when it is changed, the
actual Python code file will also be reloaded when it is changed. To
illustrate this, touch the "details.py" file such that its modification
time is updated. In this case when the page is next accessed, you should
see the "code-hits" counter drop back to zero.

</p>
<p>
Note that both the template cache and the module cache corresponding to the
code file will perform a reload of a file on any change to the modification
time of that file. Many caching systems only reload the Python code if its
modification time changed such as to be more recent than before. This could
be problematic as it wouldn't cater for cases where a much older version of
files was restored so as to replace a newer version.

</p>

<h2>Sorry, Off On Holidays</h2>

<p>
More documentation and examples to come later, including some that actually
use the messaging system. For now, also check out the following
unexplained examples.

</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="iso3166.csv">iso3166.csv</a></li>
<li><a href="iso3166.txt">iso3166.txt</a></li>
<li><a href="iso3166.html">iso3166.html</a></li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
The above is implemented by <a href="source/iso3166.py">iso3166.py</a>,
although it actually reuses a module located in "_mputils" to do the
real work.

</p>
<p>
Also check out the files <a href="source/source.py">source.py</a> and
<a href="source/source.html">source.html</a>. These together are how the
source code is being viewed, something which is normally blocked.
