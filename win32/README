The makefiles in this directory are specifically for Microsoft Visual C++.

The commands listed below need to be run from a DOS command window. Note
that you must have the Win32 POSIX thread library if you want to build in
thread support to the OSE C++ class library. The Win32 POSIX thread library
can be obtained from:

  http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32

To build "Release" DLL and import library without thread support built in
to the OSE C++ class library, run:

  nmake -f release.mk clean
  nmake -f release.mk ose_opt.dll

To build "Debug" library without thread support built in to the OSE C++
class library, run:

  nmake -f debug.mk clean
  nmake -f debug.mk ose_dbg.lib

To build "Release" DLL and import library with thread support built in to
the OSE C++ class library, run:

  nmake -f release-mt.mk clean
  nmake -f release-mt.mk ose_mt_opt.dll

To build "Debug" library with thread support built in to the OSE C++ class
library, run:

  nmake -f debug-mt.mk clean
  nmake -f debug-mt.mk ose_mt_dbg.lib

All the above should work for Visual C++ 6.0 onwards. If you have Visual
C++ 7.1 or onwards, you can build an extended version of the library which
incorporates the latest high level messaging system APIs. In this case
modify the appropriate makefile and uncomment the line:

  OBJECTS = $(OBJECTS1) $(OBJECTS2) $(OBJECTS3)
