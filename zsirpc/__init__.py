# This module only exists because for a
# brief time a Python module called "zsirpc"
# was released which was a renamed version
# of bits of the "netrpc" module. The
# "zsirpc" module would have dissapeared
# altogether, however it was mentioned on
# the IBM Developer Works web site. Thus for
# the time being keep this dummy module here
# for backwards compatability.
